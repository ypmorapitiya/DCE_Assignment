To run this project, please set the port number in the UI according to the server port.
When you run the application enter the number of simulations you want to simulate. I did not set a limit or validation. as an example let's assume 1000.
It shows you a graph with probability over number of simulations and the average probability.
There is a check box to set that we intend to switch the door. then the graph will re render with new probabilities and give us a clear result that switching door is increase the winning probability.
